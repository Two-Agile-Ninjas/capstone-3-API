# Capstone 3 - Agile Practices

The primarry objective of this Capstone is to learn how to work in an "Agile" team.  You may be surprised to find out how few teams truly undersatnd and adopt an "Agile" approach.  What is hoped to see coming out of Capstone III is a practical understanding of the "Agile" way of building software.

You will be organizing into Agile teams of 5 developers each.

- To start off, you will want to create a slack channel for your Capstone III team.  This will be where you start your discussions and collaboration.

- Jira, by Atlassian, is the de facto standard tool used in Agile Software development.  If you access the TEKcamp Jira board, you will find a "[Product Backlog](https://www.perforce.com/resources/hns/agile-product-backlog-basics#:~:text=In%20Agile%20development%2C%20a%20product,the%20future%20want%20to%20complete.)".  This "Product Backlog" contains a set of User Stories that need grooming and refinement.  

- You will be working in a "[Kanban](http://www.agileupgrade.com/why-90-percent-gets-kanban-wrong-and-getting-it-right/)".  After identifying the Agile team # you are a part of, head over to the Kanban board of your team found in the [JIRA TEKcamp-01-Capstone III Project](https://tekcamp.atlassian.net/jira/boards).  You will find the product backlog column on your team's Kanban board.  
1. Your first meeting with your team will be a "Grooming Ceremony". You will do the following : 
   - Further "groom" the User Stories with the Product Owner.  Most likely, the "Business Owner" will be joining your Grooming ceremonies as well to assist with this process.
   - Assign a "story point" value to each particular User story.  The story point value simply is an estimation of the amount of effort involved to bring the User Story into fruition. Read more about [Story Point Estimation](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation#:~:text=Traditional%20software%20teams%20give%20estimates,%2C%2020%2C%2040%2C%20100.).  The recommended time limit for your daily "grooming ceremonies" will be 18 minutes.
2. Next will come a  "[planning session"](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/scrum-ceremonies-made-simple/#planning).  In this session, you will decide as a team about how you want to approach completing the user stories.  
   - Firstly, your team needs to break down the user stories into a set of subtasks.
   - Secondly, your team should decide on an "extreme programming" technique to complete the kanban cards (user stories).  There are a few approaches your team may want to adopt:
      1. [Mob Programming](https://www.carlomatulessy.com/article/mob-programming-is-it-a-mobsession/)
      2. [Pair Programming](https://martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html)
      3. Solo Programming (task based)
      4. A Combination of the above
   
- Brainstorm with your team and Agile Coach about the programming approach your team wants to adopt.
  
1. Your team will also have daily "[standups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups)".  A true agile "standup" is designed to be short and to the point.  A suggested time limit for your daily standups is 12 minutes.  The three main questions that can be used in the agile standup are as follows :
   1. What did I complete yesterday?
   2. What will I work on today?
   3. Am I blocked by anything?
2. At the end of the Sprint, there will be a [Demo Ceremony](https://www.sitepoint.com/scrum-rituals-sprint-demo/) conducted by your team.  Feel free to get creative how you would like to present your Sprint Demo of your progress for the sprint.   
3. The final ceremony will be a "[retrospective"](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective).  In this retrospective, the agile team gets together and reflects on how the sprint went.  Some questions to reflect on are the following:
   1. What went well in the Sprint
   2. What could be improved
   3. What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

For each of the above ceremonies, there are <code>md</code> files available to document your ceremonies and progress.  Feel free to organize and use these documents at your discretion.  

These are the "ceremonies" that are expected from your team during this week long Agile Sprint.  Note that these are not the only times that your agile teams is allowed to communicate.  Communcation is natural even outside of the standups.  It will typically happen when two developers are working on a similar piece of functionality.  As we have been doing, slack is a good place to continue your communication as a team outside of the "ceremonies".
